# paintshop

Paint shop problem in Python


## Algorithm

- Sorting the customers choices so that we have customers with least choices first and then sort each choice so that first item is glossy (least cost)
- Create a path of choices and backtrack if we cannot satisfy all the customers (of the current path)
- Fail if we have tried all the options
